#E-diffDrive

We are developing a dual-motor e-differential system controlled by an Arduino Mega 2560.
The objective of the program is to enable the Arduino microcontroller to assign PWM signals to the ESCs, which in turn control the motor speeds, in accordance with throttle and steering inputs from an RC transmitter as well as to receive ERPM data from the ESCs to be converted to RPM to be shown in the Serial Monitor.
Here is a reference video to better understand how an e-differential system works: https://youtu.be/d01jROB0q7c
