# natDiffDrive

We are developing a dual-motor e-differential system controlled by an Arduino Mega 2560.
The objective of the program is to enable the Arduino microcontroller to assign PWM signals to the ESCs in accordance with the throttle and steering inputs as well as to receive ERPM data from the ESCs to be converted to RPM to be shown in the Serial Monitor.
Here is a reference video to better understand how an e-differential system works: https://youtu.be/d01jROB0q7c
